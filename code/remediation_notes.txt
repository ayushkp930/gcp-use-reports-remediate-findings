Remediation Notes – Google Cloud SCC Lab
========================================

1. IAM Findings
---------------
- Identified users/service accounts with broad roles such as:
  - roles/editor
  - roles/owner
- Applied least privilege:
  - Replaced Editor/Owner with specific roles (e.g. Viewer, Storage Admin).
  - Removed unused or risky IAM bindings.

2. Storage Bucket Findings
--------------------------
- Publicly accessible bucket detected.
- Bucket ACL and IAM policies reviewed.
- Public read access for "allUsers" and "allAuthenticatedUsers" removed.
- Confirmed bucket is now private and only required identities have access.

3. Network / VM Findings
------------------------
- Checked firewall rules for overly broad CIDR ranges (0.0.0.0/0).
- Restricted access to specific IP ranges where possible.
- Verified SSH/HTTP exposure and removed unnecessary open ports.

4. SCC Dashboard Validation
---------------------------
- Returned to Security Command Center dashboard.
- Confirmed:
  - High severity findings reduced or resolved.
  - IAM and bucket misconfiguration findings closed.
- Took final screenshot of clean(er) dashboard.

5. Lessons Learned
------------------
- SCC provides a centralized view of misconfigurations.
- Small IAM mistakes can create large security risks.
- Storing data in public buckets accidentally is a common risk.
- Continuous monitoring and remediation are critical for cloud security.
